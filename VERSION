# This is the VERSION file for PMIx, describing the precise
# version of PMIx in this distribution.  The various components of
# the version number below are combined to form a single version
# number string.

# major, minor, and release are generally combined in the form
# <major>.<minor>.<release>.

major=1
minor=0
release=0

# greek is used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is non-empty,
# it will be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be
# numeric.  Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1), b1 or (beta release 1).
# The only requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII
# characters and have no white space.

greek=a1

# If want_repo_rev=1, then the repo revision number will be included
# in the overall PMIx version number in some form.

want_repo_rev=0

# If repo_rev=-1, then the repository version number will be obtained
# dynamically at run time, either:
#
# 1) via the "git log -1" command (if this is a Git clone) in the form
#    of "git<hash>", using the hash tag at the HEAD
# 4) with the date (if the above doesn't work) in the form of
#    "date<date>".
#
# Alternatively, if repo_rev is not -1, the value of repo_rev_r will
# be directly appended to the version string.  This happens during
# "make dist", for example: if the distribution tarball is being made
# from a git checkout, if repo_rev=-1, then its value is replaced
# with the output of "gitversion".

repo_rev=gitb86d402

# The date when this release was created

date="Feb 09, 2015"

# The shared library version of each of PMIx's public libraries.
# These versions are maintained in accordance with the "Library
# Interface Versions" chapter from the GNU Libtool documentation.
# All changes in these version numbers are dictated by the PMIx
# release managers (not individual developers).  Notes:

# 1. Since these version numbers are associated with *releases*, the
# version numbers maintained on the PMIx Github trunk (and developer
# branches) is always 0:0:0 for all libraries.

# 2. The version number of libpmix refers to the public pmix interfaces.
# It does not refer to any internal interfaces.

# Version numbers are described in the Libtool current:revision:age
# format.

libpmix_so_version=0:0:0
